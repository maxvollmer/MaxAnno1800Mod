A bit more detailed explanation what this does:

1) Extended zoom:

 - Adds 6 additional zoom levels.
 - Lowest zoom level goes down to 1m above ground.
 - Highest zoom level goes up to 1800m above ground.
 - Max view distance is increased to 5km in all quality settings.
 - Might affect performance on non-high-end PCs.

2) Square ornament:

 - Adds a square ornament to the artisan city ornaments build menu.
 - It fits perfectly with the other city ornaments, e.g. city benches or the news stand.

 3) Hidden city ornaments:

 - A bunch of ornaments used in the campaign. Some statues, a fountain, another square.
 - Accessible in the artisan city ornaments build menu.

 4) Club ornaments:

 - Enables all Ubisoft club reward ornaments: Chess tables, lion statue, big park fountain and 1602 monument.

 5) (Experimental) Visual buildings ornamentas:

 - Use at own risk. Turns some visual buildings into ornamental buildings:
 - cemetery church, cemetery decorative building, cemetery mausoleum, cemetery ground/square (similar to the city square, but slightly lighter), blake's mansion.
 - Made accessible in U-Club reward build menu.

 6) (Cheat) Unrestricted access to all World Fair ornaments:

 - Ornaments that are usually only available through architecture events in the World's Fair become available in the investor city ornaments build menu.
 - Please note that this is a hack.
 - If you play in multiplayer, and your co-players do not have these ornaments enabled, then your co-players will see a bunch of "normal" ornaments instead.
 - If you uninstall this mod, these ornaments will turn into "normal" ornaments.
 - Normal ornaments: Hedge ornaments, fence ornaments, city square, city statue.
 - (Note that this refers only to the cheat World Fair ornaments, all other ornaments you built through this mod remain on your island after uninstalling and are correctly visible in multiplayer.)

 7) (Cheat) ornament attractiveness boost:

 - Attractiveness of ornaments in the original game is based on how much space they use. With this enabled, the price they cost is added to the effect they have.
 - 1000 coins are equivalent to 1 square of space.
